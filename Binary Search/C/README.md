# Binary Search algorithm on C language

#### What do we have?<br>
1. `binary_search.c` - our algorithm is here, obviously.
2. `test_files` - directory with some number of tests.
3. `Makefile` - app-builder file

#### Usage<br>

Write `make search` in the terminal (important note: you should be in C folder)<br>
*there should be screenshot*<br>

Now you can see `search` file in the directory.
Let's test it manually with following command:<br>
`./search 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`<br>
*there should be screenshot*<br>
First argument 10 means that we want search in an array with size of 10<br>
Other arguments simply our elements in array.

Let's test it with `make test` command:<br>
*there should be screenshot*
